# 🏀 WNBA Player Scoring Predictor – My First Machine Learning Slam Dunk!

Welcome to my very first data science and machine learning project, where I dive into the world of WNBA stats like a rookie ready for her first triple-double! 👟💻

This project is all about using real WNBA player data to **predict whether a player will score above their season average** — because why not mix my love for basketball with my new obsession with data science?

---

## 🎯 What’s the Goal?

Build a simple neural network that takes in stats like:
- 🧠 **True Shooting Percentage (`TS_pct`)**
- 💼 **Usage Rate (`USG_pct`)**
- 🏃‍♀️ **Assists Per Game (`APG`)**
- 📊 And other cool stats...

...and predicts whether a player’s going to **light it up on the court** or have an average game.

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to clean and explore real sports data (thanks FiveThirtyEight! 🙌)
- How to engineer features that actually *mean* something
- How to build and tune a neural network using **scikit-learn** and **GridSearchCV**
- How to stay calm when I get a `KeyError` and don’t panic 😅

---

## 🧠 Tools I Used

- Python (aka my coding sidekick)
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn (for building and optimizing the model)
- Jupyter Notebook (because I like seeing my code and results in the same place)

---

## 🚀 What’s Next?

I'd love to:
- 🎨 Turn this into an interactive web app with Streamlit
- 🏀 Add more WNBA seasons or even NCAA women's data
- 💬 Let users pick a player and run predictions in real-time

## 🙋🏽‍♀️ Why WNBA?

Because women’s sports deserve just as much data love as anything else.  
And let’s be real — the WNBA is full of absolute hoopers 💪
